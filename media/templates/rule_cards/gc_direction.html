{% block description %}
    I make a wish for a strategy that says:
    <br><br>
    All GC-pairs in the in multiloopjunctions, have to turn in same direction.
    (Red nucleotide to the right and green nucleotide to the left.)
    Exception: the GC-pair connecting multiloop and neck,are allowed to turn in both directions, without being penalized.
    <br><br>
    I would like to give â€“2 point for each wrong turning GC-pair.

    score\, =\, 100\\
    score\, =\, score\, -\, (\text{number of GC pairs in wrong directions adjacent to multiloops except those in the first stack from 5' end}) * 1.00 [5.71]\\
    score\, =\, score\, -\, (\text{number of non-GC pairs adjacent to multiloops}) * 2.00 [6.63]
